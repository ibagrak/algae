# Algae is an application template for [Google App Engine](http://https://developers.google.com/appengine/)

Algae is designed to get you up to speed and running on Google App Engine in less than 3 minutes and 42 seconds. Guaranteed or your money back.

Algae integrates de facto industry standards (like Twitter Bootstrap and HTML5 Boilerplate) with features every web app needs (like user management and third-party authentication). It's flexible, functional, and easy to use.

Here is what you get: 

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html)
* [Less Stylesheets](http://lesscss.org/) + [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/)
* User account framework, including:
    * Twitter authentication
    * Facebook authentication
    * Email authentication
    * Others (Work in progress)
* Plain and RESTful-style API bootstrap code, including
	* Auto-generation of HTML forms from GAE data models
	* Seamless entity CRUD via AJAX
* [jQuery form validation](http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation)
* [jQuery datepicker](http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker)
* Basic testing infrastructure with [Webtest](http://webtest.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
* and more..

Finally, an App Engine template you can write home about.
